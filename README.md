**Retail Sales Data Warehouse & Analytics Project**

Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a Retail Sales Data Warehouse & Analytics system using MySQL. The goal was to create a robust, high-performance data warehouse that consolidates retail sales data from various sources into a structured format, enabling efficient analysis and reporting. The solution follows a star schema design with one fact table and multiple dimension tables.

Problem Statement
Retail companies often face challenges such as:

Data Silos: Sales, customer, and product data are spread across different systems, hindering a unified view.
Slow Reporting: Traditional methods of report generation are time-consuming and lack real-time insights.
Data Quality Issues: Raw data often contains inconsistencies and requires extensive cleaning.
Lack of Historical Analysis: Without proper consolidation, tracking trends and seasonal patterns over time is difficult.
Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, I developed a data warehouse solution that:

Consolidates Data: Utilizes a star schema with one fact table (fact_sales) and three dimension tables (dim_customer, dim_product, and dim_date).
Implements ETL Processes: Uses MySQL’s LOAD DATA INFILE along with temporary tables to efficiently extract, transform, and load raw CSV data into structured tables.
Optimizes Performance: Applies indexing on key columns and uses stored procedures for automated monthly sales reports.
Enables Actionable Insights: Provides analytical queries for total sales by product category, monthly sales trends, and customer demographic analysis.
Tools and Technologies
MySQL: Database management system used to create and manage the data warehouse.
SQL: For database design, data manipulation, ETL processes, and writing analytical queries.
MySQL Workbench: Used for database modeling and generating ER diagrams.
ETL Techniques: Loading and transforming raw data using MySQL's LOAD DATA INFILE command and temporary tables.
Stored Procedures: Automating the generation of monthly sales reports.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your_username/RetailSalesDW_Project.git
cd RetailSalesDW_Project
Set Up the Database:

Open MySQL Workbench or your preferred MySQL client.
Execute the SQL script located in the sql/ folder (e.g., retail_sales.sql). This script will:
Create the RetailSalesDW database.
Create dimension tables (dim_customer, dim_product, dim_date) and the fact table (fact_sales).
Create a temporary table to load raw CSV data.
Load data from retail_sales_dataset.csv into the temporary table.
Populate the dimension tables and fact table.
Create indexes and stored procedures for analytics.
Verify the Setup:

Run sample analytical queries provided in the script to ensure that the data is correctly loaded and that the reports are generated as expected.
Usage
Analytical Queries:
After setting up the database, you can run analytical queries such as:

Total Sales by Product Category:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT dp.product_category, SUM(fs.total_amount) AS total_sales
FROM fact_sales fs
JOIN dim_product dp ON fs.product_category = dp.product_category
GROUP BY dp.product_category;
Monthly Sales Trends:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT dd.year, dd.month, SUM(fs.total_amount) AS monthly_sales
FROM fact_sales fs
JOIN dim_date dd ON fs.date = dd.date
GROUP BY dd.year, dd.month
ORDER BY dd.year, dd.month;
Stored Procedure for Monthly Sales Report:

Generate a monthly sales report by calling:
sql
Copy
Edit
CALL GetMonthlySalesReport(2023, 1);
Impact & Achievements
Enhanced Decision-Making:
The data warehouse enables quick and accurate insights into sales performance, inventory management, and customer behavior.
Improved Reporting Efficiency:
Automated ETL processes and optimized queries reduce manual effort and processing time.
Scalability:
The star schema design and indexing strategy ensure that the system can handle increasing volumes of data without performance degradation.
Actionable Insights:
Analytical queries and stored procedures provide the business with actionable data to drive marketing strategies and operational improvements.
Key Learnings
Database Design & Modeling:
Gained hands-on experience in designing a star schema and managing relational databases.
ETL Process Development:
Learned to effectively extract, transform, and load raw data using MySQL’s LOAD DATA INFILE and temporary tables.
SQL Optimization:
Enhanced skills in writing and optimizing complex SQL queries, indexing, and stored procedure development.
Problem-Solving:
Overcame challenges related to data quality, foreign key constraints, and performance tuning.
Business Intelligence:
Developed a strong understanding of how to translate raw data into actionable business insights.
